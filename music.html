                <p>"Titanic" has always been one of my favorite movies, with its portrayal of 
                    the timeless love between Jack and Rose resonating deeply with me. The theme song, "My Heart Will Go On," 
                    is not just widely recognized but also holds a special place in my heart. Playing it on the piano allows me 
                    to relive the emotions and memories attached to both the film and the song.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>The piano score I've chosen is by David Osborne, whose interpretation captures the essence of the song beautifully. 
                    You can find his performance on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkisgOVIeYQ&t=220s" color="blue">youtube</a>. For those interested in the technical side, the score is available at <a href="https://www.musicnotes.com/sheetmusic/mtd.asp?ppn=MN0213138">Musicnotes</a>. 
                    This particular arrangement has some intricate sections that challenge me and parts that I find profoundly enjoyable to play.

                <h2>Merry Christmas, Mr. Lawrence</h2>
                <!-- <p class=date>/ AI Agent / Edeucation / Open-Source Analysis tool /</p> -->
                <br>
                
                <p>
                    The hauntingly beautiful strains of 'Merry Christmas, Mr. Lawrence' first captivated me upon my 
                    initial listening, a melody that remains etched in my mind. Composed by the legendary Ryuichi Sakamoto, 
                    this piece is not just a testament to his musical genius but also to his indomitable spirit. 
                    As a composer and pianist, Sakamoto-san has contributed richly to the world of music with his evocative 
                    compositions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    His courage and resilience in the face of illness are profoundly inspiring. 
                    Despite battling a tumor, Ryuichi Sakamoto's dedication to his art is unwavering, 
                    a true embodiment of the belief that music is a life force. It is with deep respect and 
                    a kindred spirit of never yielding to adversity that I present my rendition of this iconic piece.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In playing 'Merry Christmas, Mr. Lawrence,' I strive to channel some of Sakamoto's extraordinary 
                    courage and passion. His music is a reminder of the power of perseverance, and I hope to honor his 
                    legacy through my performance. May it be a tribute not just to his artistry but to the enduring 
                    human spirit that he so remarkably represents.

                <h2>Merry-go-round of life</h2>
                <br>
                <p>
                    I've always been drawn to the music of 'Merry-go-round of Life' because it has the feel of a romantic waltz. 
                    It's a piece that takes you on a journey, with a melody that swings you gently back and forth, just like a dance.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have a deep appreciation for Joe Hisaishi's work, especially his film scores. 
                    They have a way of perfectly capturing the emotions of a scene, and 'Merry-go-round of Life' is no exception. 
                    Playing Hisaishi's music is always a joy for me, and I hope you'll enjoy listening to it as much as I enjoy 
                    bringing it to life on the piano.
